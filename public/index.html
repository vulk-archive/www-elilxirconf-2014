              <h6>Pipe Dreams</h6>
              <p>The Elixir pipe is one of the most distinctive features of the new language. Pipes allow the expression of ideas as a series of transformations, which is the essence of functional programming. But sometimes pipes fail, when return values are not uniform, or when policies change.<br>
              This talk shows how the combination of pipes and macros makes a better and more uniform experience for both API producers and consumers. Be prepared to take a detailed look at macros, how they work, and how they can play a big role in this popular programming feature, the pipe.</p>

              <h6>Thinking In A Highly Concurrent, Mostly-functional Language</h6>
              <p>Yale Professor Alan Perlis once wrote, &ldquo;A language that doesn’t affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.&rdquo;<br>
              To really appreciate the power of the actor model, no matter if you are using Go, Rust, AKKA or Erlang, you need to learn to think concurrently. Erlang has for decades been leading the way in concurrent thinking and developers from different communities and backgrounds have a lot to learn from its approach.<br>
              This talk illustrates by example how embracing the Erlang way of thinking about problems leads to scalable and fault-tolerant designs. It will describe three ways of clustering Erlang nodes within the server side domain, describing how these systems have evolved as the concurrency model and the underlying hardware got more powerful.<br>
              Through these case studies, we will describe how Erlang, and more specifically, concurrency was done in 1995 when the limit of processes was 30,000, with an evolution as to how concurrency is used and applied today, when the limit of simultaneous processes in the magnitude of millions per virtual machine.</p>

              <h6>Elixir Elevated</h6>
              <p>An elevator simulation has been my side project to explore Elixir and OTP specifically. It's been a nice subject because it is familiar enough and rich enough to go beyond the first StateServer OTP introduction, but without going too far. It's inherently concurrent, has familiar expected interactions between processes, and variations to play with. In this talk we'll go through building this elevator simulation step by step, exploring the OTP APIs, and avoiding the pitfalls.</p>

              <h6>Writing Command Line Applications With Elixir</h6>
              <p>"I'd love to check out and learn Elixir but I don't really have a problem that is big enough or one that Elixir is well suited for."<br>
              How many times have you heard this?<br>
              I have been writing small command line applications using Elixir to solve some of the same kind of problems that I used to use languages like Ruby or Python for in the past and I'm loving it! Elixir and Mix each come with great tools out of the box for writing these kind programs. Additionally, meta-programming, macros, protocols, pipes, and pattern matching can be leveraged to break down problems into small, readable, and easily digested code.<br>
              Elixir is a very expressive language that is good at solving all manner of problems in an elegant way. That means even problems where concurrency, high availability, and code reloading are not important or are less of a concern.<br>
              Yes, Elixir is a powerful language but it is also fun and a great way to think about and express problems in a different way.<br>
              By the end of my talk I hope other people will feel the same way as I do about Elixir and go forth and create programs to solve problems of any size.</p>

              <h6>Introduction to Elixir for Rubyists</h6>
              <p>Elixir is a concurrency-oriented programming language built atop the Erlang VM. Its syntax is very Ruby-influenced, and it takes some great features from the Python world as well. In this talk, Josh will provide a quick introduction to the language. He'll also provide a quick overview of the language syntactically, as well as cover some areas where it differs wildly from Ruby.</p>

              <p>I'm the CTO of Isotope11, a mildly successful software development company that focuses on Ruby, JavaScript, and Erlang/Elixir. I'm also responsible for http://www.elixirsips.com, a screencast series wherein I walk through elixir as I learn it, and record 2 shortish (5-12 minutes, occasionally longer) videos per week. I've also been a co-author and a technical reviewer for multiple books on the Arduino microprocessor and Ruby, and have had a lot of fun doing robotics with Ruby as well. I'm currently aiming to bring that robotics fun to Erlang (or Elixir).</p>

              <h6>Otp In Production: The Nitty-Gritty Details Of Game Servers</h6>
              <p><a href="http://sauspiel.de">sauspiel.de</a> is Germany's (and the world's) biggest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schafkopf">Schafkopf</a> website with 235,000 games every day. <a href="http://boldpokerapp.com">Bold Poker</a> "replaces your deck of cards with iPhones" and is made by the same team. Both could not exist without Erlang/OTP. This talk covers the nitty-gritty details of how their game servers work.<br>
              Martin will talk about each of the following points from a high level perspective, what we do, and why, and then show the interesting pieces of code that make it work:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Building and shipping releases using hot code loading: The tools we built (from helping us test code change upgrades before we deploy them, to performing the actual deploy), where we (re)use custom code_change functions, what they do, why we need them.</li>
                <li>"Takeovers" where we switch users from game server node A to B in order to do hardware/software (kernel upgrade etc) maintenance without interruptions. What was necessary to support that, how they work.</li>
                <li>Interfacing between Rails and Erlang</li>
                <li>Clients disconnecting and reconnecting (e.g. the user presses F5 while playing)</li>
                <li>Database downtime (hint: we don't just cancel the running games)</li>
                <li>Integrating Elixir into our Erlang codebase, the issues we ran into (not many :) ) and how we worked around them</li>
                <li>Itegration tests, testing upgrades before deploys</li>
                <li>Monitoring the nodes in production (and how we used custom GC settings to reduce memory usage _a lot_)</li>
                <li>Modularizing the sauspiel.de game server to support three other games too: bummerl.at, fuchstreff.de and skatstube.de</li>
              </ul>

              <p>This talk expects some familiarity with OTP, knowing Erlang the language is not necessary, all code snippets will be translated into equivalent Elixir.</p>

              <h6>The First Few Sips</h6>
              <p>Haskell, Clojure, Scala, Scheme. We all have a laundry list of functional programming languages that we tried to have our functional programming epiphany with, but it just didn't happen. Then along came Elixir. This exciting new programming language ripped the clothing off of functional programming (FP) and showed us that FP isn't some esoteric paradigm reserved only for those with PhDs in Math Wizardry. Elixir showed us that FP is about the transformation of data -- and that it can be fun!<br>
              As a newcomer to Elixir and coming from an object-oriented background, join me as I share my thoughts and experiences from my journey learning Elixir. Other newcomers should be able to relate. The more experienced Elixir users will be able to see where new users are getting hung up at so that we can target pain points and increase the adoption of Elixir.</p>

              <h6>Elixir in an Enterprise Telecommunications Product</h6>
              <p>We will discuss the experience of productizing and delivering a commercial legacy telephone emulator with Elixir. In addition to looking at designing the solution, the motivation to move to Elixir, porting legacy C code to Elixir, we will discuss introducing a new programming language to a small business. The solution we will be reviewing includes multiple TCP servers, reliable UDP clients and servers, sun rpc, xml, state machines, and a administrator console.</p>
